# Rama Khalil

MSc student in **Computational Physics** at Stockholm University and research student at **Nordita – Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics**, working in the condensed matter physics group under **Dr. Alexander Balatsky**, in collaboration with **Rigetti Computing**.

My interests sit at the intersection of **quantum technologies, machine learning, computational modeling, and data-driven problem solving**. I enjoy building tools that turn complex physical systems into tractable computational problems, and extracting real insight from numerical experiments.

I am also broadly interested in roles involving **data science, software engineering, and analytical problem-solving**, where quantitative reasoning and modelling meet real-world impact.

## 🔬 Current Research

### **Machine-Learning–Accelerated Qubit Spectroscopy (Nordita × Rigetti)**
*2025 – Present*

I am investigating **decoherence mechanisms in superconducting transmon qubits**, developing:

- Synthetic noise models and dissipation profiles for quantum circuits  
- Numerical simulations of qubit–environment interactions  
- Machine-learning methods for predicting coherence times and identifying decoherence signatures  

This work bridges machine-learning, quantum physics, modern numerical methods, and data-driven modelling, and is part of Nordita’s ongoing collaboration with Rigetti on quantum device characterization.  
(A public repository will be available once the code is finalized.)
